## Folder Structure

### working_pipeline_code.py

This file contains our camera + image processing code.

### Robot.py

This file is taken from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-HAT-Python-Library/blob/master/examples/Robot.py, and allows us to control robot movements using the Adafruit_MotorHat driver.

### Docker_Instructions.md

A markdown file containing Docker instructions our team found helpful.

### copy_files.sh
Code to automatically copy files from a Docker container on robot to local system.

### Prior Attempts

#### WIP_distance_object_code.py

Code we were initially trying in order to get the distance of an object to the camera, while implementing the original logic.

#### duckie_detection
Contains code files with object detection mechanism attempts.

#### wheels
Contains code files for programatic control of wheels and lane following attempts.

#### initial_ROS_package_attempts
Contains the code files for the attempts we made for the ROS package we created to isolate the camera and image processing nodes.

#### initial_pipeline_code
Contains the code files for the attempts we made for the final pipeline/workflow (camera + image processing node in one file).
